Simple stamp inventory tracker for my company, utilizing a Google Spreadsheet as the database/storage. 


//Still to implement:
- Change background color of display cells when below desired threshold
- Buttons / toggle for inks
- Forms need to add functionality, so values are stored/updated when entered 
- Refresh main display after used / stocked values entered
- Be certain look is decent on phone (currently display is good but form X goes outside of box)
