Simple stamp inventory tracker for my company, utilizing a Google Spreadsheet as the database/storage. 


//Still to implement:
- Change background color of display cells when below desired threshold
- Buttons / toggle for inks
- Set up form (or similar) to change values when used
    -- Used form has main look - need to adjust position of finished button
    -- Also need to add functionality, so values are stored/updated when entered
    -- A little more work needed on toggling buttons/display for form
- Another form set up when restocked 
- Refresh main display after used / stocked values entered
