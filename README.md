Simple stamp inventory tracker for my company, utilizing a Google Spreadsheet as the database/storage. 


//Still to implement:
- Change background color of display cells when below desired threshold
- Buttons / toggle for inks
- Set up form (or similar) to change values when used (need to add functionality to form values, more work on buttons toggling correctly)
- Another form set up when restocked 
- Refresh main display after used / stocked values entered
